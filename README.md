# Students Performance Indicator
## This repository contains a full pipeline for an end-to-end machine learning project—from data ingestion to deployment.
## Overview
### This project demonstrates a complete workflow for machine learning:

- Data ingestion – load, validate, and store datasets

- Data transformation – feature engineering, preprocessing

- Model training & evaluation – train, test, validate, log metrics

- Prediction pipeline – inference from raw input to output

- Deployment-ready structure

## Key Components
- Data ingestion – handles dataset reading, validation, and storage

- Data transformation – scales features, encodes categorical variables

- Model trainer – trains model(s), logs metrics, performs validation

- Prediction pipeline – wraps preprocessing and model inference for easy deployment

## Technologies
- Python – primary language

- Pandas, NumPy – data handling

- scikit-learn – ML model training

- Logging, Exception handling – robust execution
